        </section>

        <section class="content">
            <h3>Black-Scholes Model</h3>
            <p>
                The Black-Scholes model is a fundamental equation in financial mathematics used for pricing 
                European-style options. Developed by Fischer Black, Myron Scholes, and Robert Merton in 1973, 
                it revolutionized derivatives trading by providing a closed-form solution for option valuation.

            <div class="formula">
                <p><strong>Key Assumptions:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>No arbitrage opportunities</li>
                    <li>Constant risk-free rate and volatility</li>
                    <li>Log-normal distribution of stock prices</li>
                    <li>No transaction costs or taxes</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Stochastic Calculus</h3>
            <p>
                Stochastic calculus extends traditional calculus to handle random processes. In finance, 
                it's essential for modeling asset price movements and deriving pricing equations. The most 
                important concept is the Wiener process (Brownian motion), which forms the basis for modeling 
                continuous-time random behavior in financial markets.

            <h3>Monte Carlo Simulation</h3>
            <p>
                Monte Carlo methods use repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. In financial 
                engineering, these simulations are invaluable for:

                    <h4>Option Pricing</h4>
                    <p>Valuing complex derivatives with path-dependent features that lack closed-form solutions.</p>

            </div>

            <h3>Interest Rate Models</h3>
            <p>
                Interest rate models describe the evolution of interest rates over time. Popular models include:
            </p>
            <ul class="applications-list">
                <li><strong>Vasicek Model:</strong> Mean-reverting short rate model</li>
                <li><strong>Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR):</strong> Ensures positive interest rates</li>
                <li><strong>Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM):</strong> Models the entire forward rate curve</li>
                <li><strong>LIBOR Market Model:</strong> Industry standard for pricing interest rate derivatives</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Value at Risk (VaR)</h3>
            <p>
                Value at Risk is a widely-used risk metric that estimates the maximum potential loss in a portfolio 
                over a specific time period at a given confidence level. For example, a one-day 95% VaR of $1 million 
                means there's a 5% chance of losing more than $1 million in a single day.
